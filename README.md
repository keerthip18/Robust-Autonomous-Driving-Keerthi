# Robust Autonomous Driving under Behavioral and Sensor Uncertainty

This repository contains my project for CS378 Geometric Foundations of Data Science.

## Files
- `Keerthi's Updated Safe_ReinforcementLearning_baseline_code.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook implementing environment setup, robust planning extensions, value iteration, policy iteration, and extra-credit visualization.

## How to Run
- Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
- Upload the notebook file.
- Execute all cells sequentially.
- Demo includes environment interaction, reward visualization, and toy MDP planning demonstrations.

## Requirements
- `gym`
- `highway-env`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- (Colab already has these installed by default.)

## Demo Highlights
- Roundabout environment with randomized drivers and noisy sensors.
- Extra-credit visualization of total rewards.
- Toy GridWorld demonstrating Value Iteration and Policy Iteration.
